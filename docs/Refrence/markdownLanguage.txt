Need to get a better name for this file
This will be a key of different formatting symbols that the system can read,
and what they do.

Currently, need to come up with this system and how it works.

goals in tiers (from highest to lowest priority/possibility):
0) newlines
1) Bold, Itallics
2) emoji substitution (maybe)
3) Text coloring

Formatting style ideas:
    -Discord inspired; *Itallics*, **Bold**, ***Bold Itallic***
    -HTML inspired; <b>Bold<\b>, etc.
    -Attribute style: most different so i need to explain it:
    it'd use a character combo that would have no other possible use case, and then allow a user
    to assign attributes to some text, like bold, itallics, or even a good integration case for coloration and the like.
    possible example: 
    ~~{"text here", [b, i]} for bold and itallic text
